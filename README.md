# How to run
Run the file `another_main.py`.

The `main()` function contains 3 different functions that can be run. They should be commented/uncommented depending on what you want to achieve.

- `standard_run()` - runs all 4 algorithms on a specified puzzle and prints the goal/search paths to output files.
- `twenty_run()` performs and analyzes the algorithms on the random puzzle set in `20puzzles.txt`.
- `twenty_generate()` - generates 20 random 3x3 puzzles and saves them to `20puzzles.txt`.
